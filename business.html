	<h2>Feb. 2, 2018: Larry Nance Jr. Wore Our Shirt</h2>
	</p>
	<p>
		The morning of Februare 2nd, my business partner stormed in to my room
		with excitement! He had just seen a tweet showing NBA player Larry Nance Jr.
		wearing a shirt we designed. This made many headlines because the shirt was
		designed after his father, Larry Nance Sr., who was a dazzling dunker in the
		1980's!

		<h1>My Trip To Boston</h1>
	</p>
	<p>
		<h2>Nov. 8: Today We Leave!</h2>
	</p>
	<p>
		Today my friend Vincent and I packed our bags and made the 3 hour journey
		to Boston, Massachusetts. We still have 3 days to go before we get to do what we
		came here for: watch the Celtics game! On our way to Mass. we stopped by a sports
		card shop in Portland. Hopefully I can get a few cards autographed at the game.
	</p>
	<p>	
		<h2>Nov. 11: Game Day!</h2>
	</p>
	<p>
		It's finally here! I'm so pumped to see my Celtics again. The game is pretty late
		at night, so no blogging after the game for me, but I'll check back in tomorrow! We're
		just about to hit the train to TD Garden. Wish me luck!

		<h2>Collecting Autographs</h2>
	</p>
	<p>
		Ever since I was 10 years old and got a letter back from R.L. Stine, I've loved to
		collect autographs through the mail. Basically, I'd write a letter to a celebrity,
		ask them to autograph a picture or a card that I included, and I'd include a stamped
		envelope for them to mail the autograph back. I've amassed hundreds of (mostly basketball
		cards) autographs this way.
	</p>
		<h2>Video Games</h2>
	</p>
	<p>
		When I was young, I never really got to play video games like other kids. That's not necessarily
		a bad thing, but it made me appreciate the games I did have as a child, like the old Pokemon
		games I had for my Gameboy. These evolved in to the games I played now on Xbox like
		Rocket League or Call of Duty.

		<h2>Music</h2>
	</p>
	<p>
		Much like video games, I didn't reallt get to experience much music until my teens. Because of
		this, though, my taste in music is very much my own. I love to listen to alternative rock 
		bands such as Awolnation, Queen, and Jefferson Starship. I also enjoy rap music by artists like
		Childish Gambino, Tech N9ne, and Eminem.

		My favorite sport to watch or play is basketball. I played basketball from 8th grade
		to my junior year of high school. My favorite basketball team is the Boston Celtics.

		<h2>Baseball</h2>
	</p>
	<p>
		Baseball was the first sport I ever played. Even though it's boring to watch, it was
		always so fun to play. I played baseball from 1st grade up until my junior year of 
		high school. I was on the team that won a state championship my freshman year. My 
		father (baseball), sister (volleyball), and mother (swimming) all won a state championship
		as well!
